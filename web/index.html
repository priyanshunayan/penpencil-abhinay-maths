								This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected from visitors to the finding x & its website, why
								the information is collected and how it is used. It also explains user options for accessing and managing
								information, our data security practices and other matters.

								The website is operated and owned by finding x and is subject to our

								Terms of Use.

								Why we collect personal information?

								We collect personal information from you to identify you, to ensure that we provide you with the

								Correct feedback regarding your performance in various tests, and to help us deliver a superior

								educational experience. Information collected enables us to give you convenient access to our

								service offerings and products, and may help us tailor your educational experience.

								What Information do we collect and how do we use it?

								1. Information you provide:

								We collect information to provide more effective services. We ask for your name, email address,

								and other personal information when you register to use certain features of our website. We

								also may ask for this information at other times, such as when you enter contests or other

								promotions sponsored by us and/or our partners. We may also ask you to submit your ID and

								Address Proof such as Passport, Aadhar Card, Pan Card, Voter ID card etc. If you use a feature

								that requires payment of a fee, we collect your credit card data or payment account information.

								If you choose to use our invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we ask you for

								information to send the invitation (such as your friend's email address). We automatically send

								your friend a one-time email or instant message inviting him/her to visit our site. We store this

								information to: send this one-time invitation, register a referral if your invitation is accepted, and

								track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at our registered office

								address to request that we remove this information from our database. When you use one of

								our paid products, we track the web pages, and information that has been accessed by you, and

								store it on our servers. This enables us to track items that you have completed, and those that

								you need to see.

								2. Cookies:

								We send cookies (small files containing a string of characters) to your computer, thereby

								uniquely identifying your browser. Cookies are used to track your preferences, help you login

								faster, and aggregated to determine user trends. This data is used to improve our offerings,

								such as providing more content in areas of greater interest to a majority of users. Most

								browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all

								cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some of our features and services may not

								function properly if your cookies are disabled.

								3. Log information:

								When you access our website, our servers automatically record information that your browser

								sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your

								web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of

								your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

								4. User communications:

								When you send email or other communication to us, we may retain those communications in

								order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.

								5. Links:

								We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been

								followed. We use this information to improve our customized content. Clicking on links may take

								you to sites outside our domain. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other web

								sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy

								statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This

								Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Website.

								6. Alerts:

								We may alert you by email if we update our website in a way that we believe you should know

								about. Email alerts are usually prompted by new features on the websites, or substantial

								improvements in product offerings.

								7. Public Forums:

								When you use certain features on our website like the discussion forums and you post or share

								your personal information such as comments, messages, files, photos, will be available to all

								users, and will be in the public domain. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk.

								Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting on

								our forums this information may become publicly available.

								Data Security

								If use a feature requiring payment of a fee, we transmit your credit card data to our bank for

								processing. If we encounter a problem with payment, we may review the order information with

								you and our bank to resolve it. We do not otherwise disclose your credit card information. We do

								not share your email address or your personal information with third party marketers. We offer

								secure pages to collect sensitive information on our order form, such as credit card information.

								We also use administrative, physical and technical precautions to help protect the

								confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information stored on our system. We host the

								Site at a commercial-grade data center that employs extensive security practices. While no

								computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site

								reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

								Information sharing Other than the above mentioned sharing of data related to credit card information, we only
								share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of the finding x in the following
								limited circumstances: We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such
								information is reasonably necessary to :

								a. Satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request

								b. Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof

								c. Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or

								d. Protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of the finding x website or the company, its
								users or the public as required or permitted by law.



								If we become involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets,

								we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a

								different privacy policy. We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated,

								non-personal information, such as the number of users subscribed to a particular product, or the

								number of users registered on our website. Such information does not identify you individually.

								We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.

								Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a

								co-location facility for servers. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal

								information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of

								that information to our specified purposes.

								How Long Do We Retain User Data?

								Currently, we plan to retain user data while an account is active and for at least three years

								afterwards. We may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For

								example, we may lengthen the retention period for some data if needed to comply with law or

								voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise prohibited, we may shorten the retention period

								for some types of data if needed to free up storage space.

								Management of User Information:

								You can access and manage your account information. You can update your usage by

								accessing further paid services or products, or change details such as email address, and

								personal information.

								Your Consent to This Policy

								By accessing our website, you agree to this Privacy Policy. This document supersedes any prior

								communication on this topic and reflects the entire and exclusive Privacy Policy for this Site.

								provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version of it on our Site.
